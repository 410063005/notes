# Introduction
> Java is intended to be a production language, not a research language.

> Java language design has avoided including new and untested features.

本规范中将明确区分 必须在编译时检查到的 *编译时错误* 和 *运行时错误* 之间的差异。

编译：
+ 将程序转换为字节码

运行：
+ class loading & linking
+ optional machine code generation
+ dynamic optimization
+ execution

什么是 [heap pollution][heap pollution] 问题

	List l = new ArrayList<Number>();
	List<String> ls = l; // unchecked warning

> If the code above is executed, heap pollution arises, as the variable ls, declared to be a List<String>, refers to a value that is not in fact a List<String>.

> The problem cannot be identified at run-time because type variables are not reified, and thus instances do not carry any information at run-time regarding the actual type parameters used to create them.

> Assignment from a value of a raw type to a variable of a parameterized type should only be used when combining legacy code which does not make use of parameterized types with more modern code that does.
